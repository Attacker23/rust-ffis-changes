If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines:\nhttps://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n2. Run `cargo t --all-features --all-targets` to get started testing,\nand run `cargo fmt`.\n  3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR.\n4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP]\nYour PR title ...'.\n  5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\n-->\n\n## What changes are proposed in this pull request?\n<!--\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing and why the changes are\nneeded.\nThe purpose of this section is to outline the changes, why they are\nneeded, and how this PR fixes the issue.\nIf the reason for the change is already explained clearly in an issue,\nthen it does not need to be restated here.\n1. If you propose a new API or feature, clarify the use case for a new\nAPI or feature.\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\n-->\n\nThis PR provides 3 ways for engines to hook into our logging:\n1. getting a struct `Event` type with relevant information that they can\nformat\n2. A very simple call that will just pick some defaults and give them a\nstring\n3. A slightly more complex one that lets them control the string\nformatting a little, but still ultimately just hands over a string\n\nNote that the `Compact` format seems a bit broken upstream. I've filled\nhttps://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3157 for that.\n\n<!--\nUncomment this section if there are any changes affecting public APIs:\n### This PR affects the following public APIs\n\nIf there are breaking changes, please ensure the `breaking-changes`\nlabel gets added by CI, and describe why the changes are needed.\n\nNote that _new_ public APIs are not considered breaking.\n-->\n\nAdds 3 new public ffi APIs\n\n## How was this change tested?\n<!--\nPlease make sure to add test cases that check the changes thoroughly\nincluding negative and positive cases if possible.\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please\nclarify how you tested, ideally via a reproducible test documented in\nthe PR description.\n-->\n\nRunning in `read_table`, and unit tests",
