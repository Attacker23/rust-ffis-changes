This introduces a new API `visit_schema` to allow\nengines to visit any schema over FFI. An API called `visit_schema`\npreviously existed but visited the schema of a given _snapshot_; this\nhas now been renamed to `visit_snapshot_schema`.\n\n\n### This PR affects the following public APIs\nRenamed `visit_schema` to `visit_snapshot_schema` and now `visit_schema`\ntakes `SharedSchema` as an argument instead of a snapshot.\n\n\n## How was this change tested?\nupdated read_table test",
