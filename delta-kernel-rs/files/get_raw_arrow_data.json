Secondly, `ffi/src/scan.rs` included some engine data\nutilities that could be moved out and likely shared in the future\n(nothing scan-specific). This PR just moves out some of these\neasily-grouped items into separate modules:\n\n- new `mod engine_data`: the `pub fn`'s moved into `mod engine_data`\nwill need to be prefixed with `engine_data` now to resolve\n- new `mod error`: i've done `pub use error::*` so error types will be\nexposed the same.",
