The memory layout differs for sized vs. unsized types (the\nformer being more efficient), while box vs. arc is chosen based on\nwhether owned vs. shared reference semantics are desired.\n\nAll handles provide an `as_ref()` method for obtaining a shared\nreference; arc handles provide an `as_arc()` method that returns a new\nArc for the object (bumping its reference count), while box handles\nprovide an `as_mut()` method that returns a mutable reference. In all\ncases, a handle remains valid until specifically dropped by the user.",
