Additionally I've moved the schema-related things up from `scan`\nmodule to top-level in ffi crate. Exact changes listed below; this PR\nupdates tests/examples to leverage the new changes.\n\n### This PR affects the following public APIs\n\n1. Remove `visit_snapshot_schema()` API\n2. Add a new `logical_schema(snapshot)` API so you can get the schema of\na snapshot and use the `visit_schema` directly\n3. Renames `free_global_read_schema` to just `free_schema`\n4. Moves `SharedSchema` and `free_schema` up from `mod scan` into\ntop-level `ffi` crate.\n\n\n## How was this change tested?\nexisting UT",
